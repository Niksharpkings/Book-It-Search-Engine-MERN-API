# Book-It-Search-Engine-MERN-API

## !Warning! Important updated note:
> Heroku no longer supports free mangosDB mySQL database system since Nov 2022.
Thus, deployed link and app no longer function unless it's runned thru local host only at the time being. Currently looking for a free public or open souced alternative for hosting this repo live site

### WIP:
(need some additional fixing - I get to it some day)
A fully functioning Google Books API search engine built refactor into a GraphQL Apollo Server API from a RESTful API.
 The app is built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and GraphQL API.
  It's allow users to save book searches to the back end.
