# Book-It-Search-Engine-MERN-API
(need some additional fixing - I get to it some day)
A fully functioning Google Books API search engine built refactor into a GraphQL Apollo Server API from a RESTful API.
 The app is built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and GraphQL API.
  It's allow users to save book searches to the back end.
